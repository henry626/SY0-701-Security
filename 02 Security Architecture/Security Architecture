2 Security Architecture - 18%

2.1 Threat Actors are malicious attackers responsible for harming the safety or security of another entity.
  Internal/external attackers - resources/funding, level of sophistication/capability.
  Motivations include data exfiltration, espionage, service disruption, blackmail, revenge, war, etc.
  Nation states - external threats from governments/nations for revenge, disruption, or war; Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
  Threat Actors: Unskilled attackers, hacktivists, insider threats, organized criminals, shadow IT, and Nation states.

2.2 Common Threat Vectors, Phishing, Impersonation, Watering Hole Attacks, Social Engineering Attacks
  Common threat vectors - Message-based vectors (emails and SMS), Image-based vectors (XML), File-based vectors (doc, pdf, zip files), Voice call vectors (Vishing or Call tampering),
      Infected USB drives, vulnerable software vectors, unsupported systems vectors, unsecured network vectors, open service ports, default credentials, and supply chain vectors.
  Phishing - Links in emails or SMS. Social engineering with a touch of spoofing. Tricks and misdirection. Typosquatting, pretexting, Vising (voice phishing), and Smishing (SMS phishing).
  Impersonation - Attackers pretend to be from an authority such as a government agency, bank, or family to gain your trust. Eliciting personal information for identity fraud.
  Watering Hole Attacks - An attack on the 3rd party systems that the company deals with to attack the company eventually. Need layered security (defense-in-depth) through firewall, anti-virus, and anti-malware software.
  Social Engineering Attacks involve misinformation or disinformation. Fake news creates confusion and division. To elevate fake news, fake accounts, brand impersonation, and impersonated sites are used.

2.3 Memory Injections, Buffer Overflows, Race Conditions, Malicious Updates, OS Vulnerabilities, SQL Injection, Cross-site Scripting, Hardware Vulnerabilities,
  Memory Injections - inject malicious code into a running process. DLL injection.
  Buffer Overflows - overwriting a buffer of memory to execute malicious code.
  Race Conditions - Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU).  
  Malicious Updates - Always update systems for bug fixes and security patches. But not every update is equally secure. Have backups and install from trusted sources.
  OS Vulnerabilities - Update the OS as soon as possible for bug fixes and security patches. Test before deployment. Have good backups available.
  SQL Injection - inject code into the SQL query to access the entire DB. EX: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Nguyen' OR '1' = '1'"; 1=1 is always TRUE.
  Cross-site Scripting - XSS. One of the most common web app vulnerabilities. Browser security flaws. XSS commonly uses JavaScript code in the edit box on a webpage.
      Keep browsers updated, consider disabling Javascript, check input for Javascript code, and never blindly click on links from emails or text messages.
  Hardware Vulnerabilitiesâ€”IoT. HWs are controlled by embedded firmware. Manufacturers may delay firmware patches or the End of Life (EOL) of products, including legacy devices and software.
