General Security Concepts - 12%

1.1 Security Controls
  - Prevent, minimize, and limit the damage
  Technical controls: Controls implemented using systems, OS controls, Firewalls and anti-virus
  Managerial controls: Administrative controls with security design and implementation, security policies, and standard operating procedures
  Operational controls: controls implemented by people instead of systems, security guards, and awareness programs
  Physical controls: limit physical access, guard shack, fences, locks, and badge readers

  Preventive control types: block access, firewall rules, security policy, guard shack checks, door locks
  Deterrent control types: discourage an intrusion, application splash screens, the threat of demotion, reception desk, and warning signs
  Detective control types: identify and log an intrusion, collect and review logs, login reports, regularly patrol the property, and motion detectors
  Corrective control types: After an event, reverse the impact and minimize downtime. Restoring backups, policies for reporting issues, contact law enforcement, and fire extinguisher.
  Compensating control types: Control using other means temporarily. Firewall to block or patch the troubled app, separation of duties, guard duties, and generator for power outage.
  Directive control types: display security compliance. Put sensitive files in protected folders, compliance policies and procedures, train users, sign: "Authorized only."

1.2 The CIA Triad: Non-repudiation, Authentication, Authorization and Accounting, Gap Analysis, Zero Trust, Physical Security, Deception and Disruption
  CIA or AIC Triad refers to Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
  Confidentiality - prevent disclosure of info to unauthorized users. Use Encryption and Decryption. Access controls restriction. Two-factor authentication.
  Integrity - Messages can't be modified without detection. Hashing data. Digital signatures. Certificates. Non-repudiation provides proof of integrity.
  Availability - Systems and networks must be running at all times. Redundancy, fault tolerance, patching to close security holes and stability.

  Non-repudiation: proof of integrity using hash for cryptography, proof of origin by authenticating with the private key through encryption.
      plaintext -> hash -> encryption (private key).      decryption -> hash

  AAA: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
  Authentication - prove user identity with User/password
  Authorization -  grant access based on identification and authentication,
  Accounting - Login time, data sent and received, and logout time

  Authenticating systems often use digitally signed certificates to assign to authorized devices.
  Certificate authentication - An org has a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) to create and verify digitally signed certificates.  
  Authorization models - create abstract groups to assign users and services <=> data and applications.

  Gap analysis - Perform research and review to determine where we are and where we want to be.
  Choosing the framework (i.e., NIST 800-171rev2 or ISO/IEC 27001) for the organization's formal standards.
  Evaluate people and processes; compare and contrast existing systems.

  Zero Trust - Implies nothing is inherently trusted; multi-factor authentication, encryption, system permissions, firewalls, monitoring and analytics.
  Split the network info functional planes to define security policy for each: physical assets, virtual assets, and cloud assets.
  Data plane - (switches, routers, firewalls) processing, forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT frames and packets.
  Control plane - manages the actions of the data plane; policies, rules, routing tables, session tables, NAT tables.

  Adaptive identity - consider the requested resources to apply multiple risk indicators to increase the authentication factor.
  Threat scope reduction - decrease the number of possible entry points
  Policy-driven access control - combining adaptive identity with a predefined set of rules
  Security zones - trusted vs untrusted zones; internal vs external network; 
  Policy enforcement point (PEP) - policy decision point, policy engine, policy admin

  Physical Security - (i.e., Barricades/Bollards) - prevent access; channel traffic and access point; Warning signs.
  Access control vestibules (i.e., doors/fences) - designed to lock/unlock access to facilities
  Surveillance - CCTV, security guard, badge access, well lighting, sensors (infrared - motion, pressure - floor and windows, microwave - movements, ultrasonic - sound waves)


  Deception and Disruption - prevent bad actors from attacking your systems.
  Honeypots - attract bad guys as traps, virtual worlds to explore, cat & mouse game with attackers; open source for download.
  Honeynets (servers, routers, workstations cluster)
  Honeyfiles (fake files like password.txt)
  Honeytokens (traceable data - API credentials, fake email addresses)


1.3 Change Management, Technical Change Management - A formal process for upgrading/rolling back software changes, including how to make changes, their frequency, and clear policies.
  Change approval process - request forms, define the purpose, the scope, the affected resources, schedule date & time, and manager approval. 
  Ownership - An individual or entity needs to make changes and own the process; The owner manages the updates and ensures the process is followed.
  i.e., Address label printers need upgrading; the Shipping dept owns the process; IT handles the actual change.
  Stakeholders - who are impacted by the change and may not be obvious. 
  i.e., Shipping labels: shipping dept; accounting reports; product delivery timeframes; revenue recognition (CEO vis ibility)
  Impact analysis - risk value (fix or not fix the issue, breaks something else, or data corruption); not making change (security vulnerability, downtime, and availability)
  Test results - Use the sandbox testing environment before making changes to production; confirm the backout plan, such as backup systems.

  Allow list vs. Deny list: nothing runs unless it's approved, very restrictive; anti-virus, anti-malware.
  Restricted activities: The scope of a change is important; do not change something outside of the scope. Expand the change only if necessary. Determine the next steps.
  Downtime - When the services & resources are unavailable, switch to a secondary system; the goal is to minimize downtime.
  Restarts system, services, or applications
  Legacy applications - beware that they may not be supported anymore, fear of the unknown.
  Dependencies - to update A, it needs to update B. Dependencies may be across platforms.
  Documentation - track Version control
