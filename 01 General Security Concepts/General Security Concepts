1.1 Security Controls
  - Prevent, minimize, and limit the damage
  Technical controls: Controls implemented using systems, OS controls, Firewalls and anti-virus
  Managerial controls: Administrative controls with security design and implementation, security policies, and standard operating procedures
  Operational controls: controls implemented by people instead of systems, security guards, and awareness programs
  Physical controls: limit physical access, guard shack, fences, locks, and badge readers

  Preventive control types: block access, firewall rules, security policy, guard shack checks, door locks
  Deterrent control types: discourage an intrusion, application splash screens, the threat of demotion, reception desk, and warning signs
  Detective control types: identify and log an intrusion, collect and review logs, login reports, regularly patrol the property, and motion detectors
  Corrective control types: After an event, reverse the impact and minimize downtime. Restoring backups, policies for reporting issues, contact law enforcement, and fire extinguisher.
  Compensating control types: Control using other means temporarily. Firewall to block or patch the troubled app, separation of duties, guard duties, and generator for power outage.
  Directive control types: display security compliance. Put sensitive files in protected folders, compliance policies and procedures, train users, sign: "Authorized only."
