3 Security Operations - 28%

3.1 Network Infrastructure Concepts, Infrastructure Considerations
  Cloud Infrastructure - IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, etc.  Cloud security responsibility matrix.
      Hybrid considerations: A hybrid cloud with more than one public or private cloud, network protection mismatches for authentication across platforms, and different security monitoring.
      Third-party vendors in the cloud: Ongoing vendor risk assessments, including third-party impact for incident response and constant monitoring.
      Infrastructure as code: Describe an infrastructure to define servers, networks, and applications as code. Create repository versions and use descriptive comments for easy maintenance.
      Serverless architecture: Function as a Service (FaaS); when apps are separated into individual autonomous functions, run in a stateless container; 
      Microservices and APIs: API is the glue for the microservices; they are scalable, resilient, and have built-in security and compliance.
  Network Infrastructure Concepts - Physical isolation,
      Physical isolation: devices are physically separated; Customer A on one device and B on another device; Front-end web server on one rack and back-end DB on another rack.
      Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) separate networks logically instead of physically. Communication between VLANs through L3 device/router.
      Software Defined Networking (SDN) - Networking devices have different functional planes of operation, split the functions into separate logical units; 
        Infrastructure layer / Data plane - process the network frames and packets; forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT
        Control layer / Control plane - manages the data plane; routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
        Application layer / Management plane - Configure and manage the device; SSH, browser, API
  Other Infrastructure Concepts - Attacks can happen anywhere, on-premises or cloud-based.
      On-premises: You have complete control; the on-site IT team can manage security better and maintain uptime and availability;
      Centralized vs. decentralized. A centralized approach provides correlated alerts, consolidated log file analysis, and comprehensive system status. But it has a single point of failure.
      Virtualization is where each VM machine runs an operating system, and all share the same hardware.
      Virtualization => Container.  Several containers (dockers) run on an operating system installed on one hardware. Containers are run in a sandbox to isolate them from each other.
      IoT (Internet of Things) - Sensors, Smart devices, Wearable technology, Facility automation (HVAC). These IoT may have weak security protection that may cause problems to your network.
      RTOS and embedded systems also need security protection.
  Infrastructure Considerations  - Availability, Resilience, Cost, Responsiveness, Scalability, ease of deployment, risk transference, ease of recovery, patch availability, power and computing.
      Availability—System uptime is a balancing act between security and availability, monitoring, and redundant systems.
      Resilience - Something will happen; can you recover quickly? Mean time to repair (MTTR); find the root cause; replacement HW; software patch; redundant systems
      Cost—How much money is required for initial installation, ongoing maintenance, replacement or repair costs, and tax implications?
      Responsiveness - request information, speed is an important metric
      Scalability - quickly and easily increase or decrease capacity; resource challenge; Also include security monitoring.
      Ease of deployment - App has many moving parts (server, DB, firewall, etc.), and processes (HW resources, cloud budget, change control). Essential to consider during the engineering phase
      Risk Transference: Methods to minimize risk, cybersecurity insurance, recovering internal losses, and protecting against customer legal issues.
      Ease of recovery - Time is money; how quickly can you recover? Malware infection.
      Patch availability - Bug fixes, security updates, latest version check, 
      Inability to patch - This occurs frequently with embedded systems (HVAC controls, time clocks, etc.).
      Power - Lost of power, backup services (UPS - Uninterruptible power supply), generators.

3.2 Secure Infrastructures, Intrusion Prevention, Network Appliances, Port Security, Firewall Types, Secure Communication
  Secure Infrastructures - Device placement, security zones, attack surface, connectivity
      Device placement - Firewalls, separate trusted from untrusted, security checks; Honeyports, jump server, load balancers, sensors.
      Security zones - zone-based security with IP address ranges: Trusted versus Untrusted, internal versus external, severs versus databases.
      Attack surfaces—how many ways into your network? Application code, open ports, authentication process, human error. Minimize the surface by code auditing, blocking ports, and monitoring network traffic.
      Connectivity - Everything contributes to security, secure network cabling, app-level encryption, network-level encryption through IPsec tunnels, VPN connections.
  Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) - It watches network traffic and intrusions from buffer overflows or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Detection versus Prevention.
      Intrusion Detection System (IDS) - alarm or alert
      Prevention - stop it before it gets into the network.
      Failure modes - Fail-open is when the system fails, and data continues to flow. Fail-closed is when the system fails, and data does not flow. Fail-open is preferred to maintain the network.
      Active monitoring - The system is connected inline, and data can be blocked in real-time as it passes by; intrusion prevention is commonly active
      Passive monitoring—A copy of the network traffic is examined using a tap or port monitor; data cannot be blocked in real-time; intrusion detection is commonly passive.
